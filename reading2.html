        The Turing Test: I personally find myself to be pretty good at deciphering AI versus real photos and videos, but lately its been much harder. I thought it was embarrassing that I fell for the viral video of the kangaroo boarding the airplane, but after reading this, I felt a little less. Like the author, I too find myself having to check the comments of a post to ensure that something is real or AI-generated. I also like how the word ‘counterfeits’ is used in the reading referring to AI art- it seems fitting.
