        Restaurant Menus: I am someone who heavily judges a book by its cover (it’s bad– I know!) since I study design. I pay close attention to fonts, colors, boldness, and overall vibes. I actually had a recent encounter with a restaurant menu that I was really intrigued by: a classy restaurant, Miznon, in New York City, having a menu that was written in a multi-colored comic sans font. This article/interview reminded me of that, especially with the photo examples. The menus in this article seem very telling of the vibes of the restaurant, and the quality (so it may seem). I wonder what the interviewers would think of the Miznon menu and whether they would say that it encaptures the vibes of the restaurant or if it’s an exception to their opinions on restaurant menu websites.
