      1. I really liked it. It feels calming in a way that most writing about the internet doesn’t. What hit hardest was the idea that a website doesn’t have to be clear or finished or optimized— it can be quiet, weird, boring, temporary, or confusing on purpose. The metaphors make the web feel ‘physical’ again, like something you can consistently work on, not just ‘perform’ on.
<br>2. Well, I am pretty excited about the website I am making now. The reason I chose the restaurant that I did was because I absolutely despise their current menu. I feel that it does not match the character, brand identity, or consumers of the restaurant itself. I loved being able to use my design skills to fix it. I enjoy changing things to be my own. If I had to make something from scratch, I’d likely make a website where you could choose any second of any day of any year and it shows you something released then- an instagram post, an article— literally anything. That could be fun! Probably hard to code, though.
<br>3.You get to decide why it exists, not just what it shows. You can make it with any color, font— basically any preferences. When someone else makes it, the site usually becomes a profile of that person. When you make it yourself, it can be a process, a mood, a long thought, or a place you’re still figuring out. That freedom changes how you show up online/are thought of by those who view and interpret your website.
