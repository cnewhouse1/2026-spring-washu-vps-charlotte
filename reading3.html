        I really liked the way that the reading uses the idea of cyborgs because I never really thought about a cyborg in a context that wasn’t like, an evil robot, haha. it made something. The “rooms” idea especially resonates with me, because I’m way more interested in environments that support how people already think and interact, rather than piling more tech onto individual people. It feels more humane and social, less isolating. I also like that it leaves space to step in and out, instead of turning optimization into a permanent state. The reading is also pretty casual, it ends with ‘’I think”, which shows a sort of humbleness in the author.
